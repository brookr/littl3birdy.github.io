#Learning Markdown

Markdown is basically an easier way to create content for a website.  It takes mainly text input and basically does the styling for you! 
Here is what I have learned so far:

##Show the code on your website:
In markdown, you can use the backtick to create a window on your webpage that will show everything you write as it is. This is a great way to demonstrate code, so I will use it here to make "flashcards".
```
"`" 3x at the beginning and end of a block of code, will publish a window of code directly to your webpage.
```
