## Welcome to My Learning Journal!

Hello! My name is Ashlyn and this is my learning journal for Code 102. 

### About Me:

I am a California native and I have lived in the Seattle area for 19 years. I miss the beach and sunshine sometimes, but I really love living here. 

**Current Work:**
I currently work as a dog trainer in the Everett/Lynwood area. I own my own business and I specialize in working with rescue dogs. I am very passionate about my job and love the animals and people I work with. 

**Why Programming?**
I have decided to go back to school to be a full stack developer.  I have many friends that are Software Engineers and I have dabbled in coding for the last 2 years and have finally decided to go for it. 
I really enjoy the idea of being able to create things that are practical or just fun.  I would love to be able to contribute to enriching peoples lives through technology, while also building a great carreer that I can support my family with.
