# **Learning Markdown**

Markdown is an easy to use syntax that is used to style writing on the web.  Most of Markdown is text with other characters thrown in. Here is some basic markdown code I have learned so far:

## Show the code on your website:
In markdown, you can use the backtick to create a window on your webpage that will show everything you write as it is. This is a great way to demonstrate code, so I will use it here to showcase what I have learned.
```
"`" 3x at the beginning and end of a block of code
will publish a window of code directly to your webpage.
```

## **Bold** and *Italic* styling:
To create **bold** or *italicized* word styling in markdown, you use the asterick character.
```
**Your text here** makes text inside the double astericks bold.
*Your text here* makes text inside the single astericks italic.
```

## Headers:
To create headers in markdown, you use the hashtag character. The number of hashtags correlates to the importance of the header.
```
# Header Here (Same as <h1>)
## Header Here (Same as <h2>)
##### Header Here (Same as <h5>)
```

## Images:
To add images to your page using markdown, use the following formula:
```
![Alt message here (Usually a description of the image.)](url here.)
```

## Links:
To insert links to your page using markdown, use the following formula:
```
[description here](link address here)
```

There are many other markdown styling options.  Click [here](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-writing-and-formatting-on-github) for more useful style code to use in GitHub.
